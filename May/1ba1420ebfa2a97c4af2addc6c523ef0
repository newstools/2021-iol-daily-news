DURBAN - A HILLCREST woman was choked until she lost consciousness during a robbery at her home on Saturday. Three men got onto a property on Shongweni Road in Hillcrest. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said one of the victims, a 31-year-old nanny, was inside the house with the door open when she was approached by one of the robbers. Mbele said the robber tried to go into the bedroom where the baby was asleep. “He knew the baby was in the room. He heard the sound of a mobile toy. She tried to stop him. He took a knife from the kitchen and threatened her. There was a scuffle. She sustained a slight cut from the knife,” Mbele said. The robber took the nanny’s phone and she began screaming for help. A neighbour intervened and the robber dropped the phone while fleeing. During the robbery the homeowner was outside cleaning the patio when she was also approached by the other two men. Mbele said the men grabbed her and one of them tried to strangle her by putting his hands around her neck. “She could not breathe and fell unconscious. She was found by her neighbour. She was taken to hospital for medical treatment. It is alleged that her rings were stolen from her fingers,” Mbele said. Meditech Emergency Response spokesperson Derrick Banks said both women were treated for shock. Banks said the victims’ screams alerted neighbours who then chased the robbers. “One person was treated for soft tissue injuries to the neck and shoulders, as well as bruises and cuts. She was taken to a hospital for further treatment. The domestic worker was treated for shock,” he said. Proact Neighbourhood Watch spokesperson Andreas Mathios urged home owners to invest in a remote panic button from their security company. “Make a habit of wearing the device around your neck or keep it in your pocket. Press the button when you see intruders to get assistance and to activate your alarm. Join a proactive neighbourhood watch,” Mathios advised. Daily News
