DURBAN - A SECURITY guard and a bystander were shot and wounded during a cash-in-transit robbery in the Umzinto CBD on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said the robbers approached the guards outside Jwayelani supermarket. “It’s alleged that a shoot-out occurred. One of the security guards and a member of the public were shot and injured.” She said the robbers fled empty-handed. Umzinto SAPS registered an attempted business robbery and three counts of attempted murder. Last month, a policeman and a security guard were wounded, after being shot during a cash-in-transit robbery at the Durban Workshop shopping centre. The security guard was leaving the premises of a business after collecting cash when he was shot at by five suspects. The constable had been with another officer in the vicinity, conducting an investigation, and witnessed the incident. The officer managed to grab a suspect who was carrying the money box and the box fell to the ground. The suspects opened fire at the officers and the constable, stationed at Durban Central police station, was shot on the abdomen. The Hawks are investigating the attempted murders and attempted robbery. Meanwhile, 14 awaiting-trial prisoners, who escaped from a police prisoner transport vehicle, were still on the run on Tuesday. zainul.dawood@inl.co.za Daily News
