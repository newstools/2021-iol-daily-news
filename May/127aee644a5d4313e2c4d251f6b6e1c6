DURBAN - SPHELELE Zwane’s life has been brought to a standstill due to his identity document (ID) issues, caused by his late mother’s actions. He has never been in possession of a birth certificate, and getting his ID has been daunting and almost impossible. “I’d always tell my mom that they want my birth certificate in primary school. She’d always speak to the teachers and, eventually, everyone forgot about it,” said Zwane. Three years ago, Zwane found out from Home Affairs that his mother had registered three children – two registered fraudulently (ghost children). The pair, Sifiso Zwane and Sipho Zwane, caused Zwane’s problems. Sifiso Zwane’s birth date was stated as six months after Zwane’s, appearing impossible that his late mother Sibongile was indeed his mother. Zwane, who applied for an ID while in high school and living in Johannesburg after his mother’s death in 2012, was denied a birth certificate and ID. “Last December, his cousins found him hanging from a tree; trying to take his own life. I cannot afford to lose him because of this,” said Zwane’s grandmother Busisiwe Zwane. In 2019, Zwane tried applying for an ID at Isipingo Home Affairs, Durban. But the alleged fraud committed by his mother was still a stumbling block. Zwane said while awaiting processing by authorities, his life had come to a standstill. He was awaiting feedback from Umgeni Home Affairs, after interviews and DNA testing. Zwane claimed that whenever he went to enquire about his ID, he was always told it was still being processed. “I’ve missed out on a lot of opportunities due to not being recognised as an SA citizen. Not being able to support my family financially, has taken a toll on me.” Zwane completed his matric at Musi Comprehensive High School in Soweto. He wrote his final exams using his birthday, not his ID number. Umgeni Home Affairs said it would give feedback after checking his application. sinenhlanhla.zungu@inl.co.za Daily News
