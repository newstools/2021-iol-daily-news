DURBAN - INANDA’S Ziphembeleni Secondary School was rocked by allegations that pupils were fed food on Monday with maggots – for the fourth time this year. Last month, a video of a 5kg bag of samp with maggots, alleged to have been taken from the school's kitchen, was circulated on social media. Although the incident was investigated by Department of Education officials last month, as directed by MEC Kwazi Mshengu, and the department had concluded that there was “nothing wrong” with the food, another video showing amasi (sour milk) that was allegedly served for lunch on Monday – with live maggots – surfaced. Educators Union of South Africa president Scelo Bhengu said when he received the disturbing video, he alerted the department and he tweeted about it. Bhengu tweeted: "Once again, today, (10/05/2021) maggots were found in pupils' food (amasi) at Ziphembeleni Secondary in Inanda. The KZN DoE officials will again conduct their lacking dexterity investigation and issue a crooked report." But department spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi dismissed the allegation as something that was orchestrated from within. "We are investigating the matter. Our investigation, this time, is going to be deeper because we are reliably informed that this is orchestrated from within the school. “Inside the school, there is someone who is responsible for this," said Mahlambi. Last month, the Daily News reported that some pupils at the school had boycotted meals prepared by a contracted service provider as part of the National Schools Nutrition Programme after allegedly being served rotten food with maggots. The pupils, who cannot be named to protect their identities, exclusively spoke to the Daily News about the state of the meals served at the school. The majority of the pupils at the school come from poor communities in the area and rely on the food as their only proper meal of the day. sne.masuku@inl.co.za Daily News
