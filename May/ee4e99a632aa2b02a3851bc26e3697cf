DURBAN - A DRIVE-BY shooting outside a block of flats in Wentworth has claimed the life of a bystander. Police reports said a group of people were sitting outside block 25 flats on Burgess Road at 10.45pm on Friday night socialising, when a silver-grey Toyota Etios stopped. The front left passenger window opened and the passenger, who cannot be identified, fired several shots with a handgun at the group. Police said about 20 rounds could have been fired. The Etios then sped off. It is alleged Rabia Elouise was standing near the gate at the entrance to the flats. Three people had bullet wounds on their legs. Two are recovering in hospital. The concrete palisade fencing was pockmarked with bullet holes at the entrance to the flats. Burgess Road resident Rabia Elouise was laid to rest in Chatsworth on Sunday. Her mother Rachael Defleurs wrote on Facebook that her daughter was shot twice in the back. One of the bullets pierced her back and hit her heart. She posted: “I am crying for the loss of my daughter who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The drive-by shootings, we don’t know where they are from. There is no jail that will keep them who brutally killed my daughter and many others in our Wentworth community. God is wiping away our tears.” Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of murder and attempted murder was opened at Wentworth SAPS. Meanwhile, in Richards Bay, three people were shot dead and one wounded near a shopping mall parking lot on Friday night. Mbele said the men were standing next to a truck when a white BMW stopped. The occupants of the vehicle shot at them. Police were still trying to establish the motive behind the shooting and how many people were in the BMW. zainul.dawood@inl.co.za Daily News
