DURBAN - A KWAZULU-NATAL employee accused of stealing R2.4 million from his employer, G4S Cash Solutions, was expected to appear again in the Durban Magistrate’s Court for bail consideration. Sihle Lungisani Ngcobo, 32, of KwaDukuza, appeared in court this week where he was remanded in custody until his next court appearance on Monday. National Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said Ngcobo was arrested by the Hawks' Serious Organised Crime Investigation team for the alleged theft of millions. “It is alleged that in December 2019 the suspect, who was an employee at G4S, stole R2.4 million from the G4S Cash Solutions depot in Westville. A case was opened, which prompted the Hawks’ investigation,” Mogale said. After a thorough look into it, she said a warrant for Ngcobo’s arrest was issued by the court. According to Mogale, Ngcobo had been on the run since the theft incident but was this week arrested with the help of the police’s Crime Intelligence unit. “The suspect is alleged to have built a house from the suspected stolen millions and therefore the Asset Forfeiture Unit will assist with further investigation,” Mogale said. Meanwhile, Minister of Police General Bheki Cele was in the province on Thursday to visit the family home of Lieutenant-Colonel Jabulani Ndawonde, who was shot and killed this week. The acting station commander of Ndwedwe police station was driving home when he was gunned down in an apparent drive-by shooting in Ndwedwe, north of Durban, on Monday night. Ndawonde, 56, died at the scene. His murder comes days after Cele revealed during the release of the National Crime Statistics of the last quarter of 2020/2021 financial year, that 24 officers had been killed in the first three months of this year. Cele would receive a full briefing on the progress of the murder case, before visiting the family of the slain officer. Daily News
