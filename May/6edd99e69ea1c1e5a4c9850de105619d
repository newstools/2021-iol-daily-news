DURBAN - AFTER more than a month of intermittent protests and wage negotiations, the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) was expected to pay its staff salary increases on Friday. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu), who led workers in protest action and negotiations over the weeks leading up to the Council decision, was pleased with the decision. Ayanda Blessing Zulu, Nehawu’s KwaZulu-Natal general secretary said he was glad the lengthy discussions bore fruit. “We are pleased after lengthy discussions that they have come to this conclusion and we just await the Council approval of the amount. It is a victory because the amount is above CPI, which is not good but better considering we are in the midst of very difficult socio-economic times.” He said the union would continue to engage the university on other issues affecting staff, such as the conversion of temporary workers to permanent staff. Mbali Mkhize, MUT spokesperson said Friday’s payment would be the amount of money that staff should have received as part of salaries from January 2021 that organised labour and university management agreed on as the salary percentage increase which was approved by the University Council. She said the decision to pay out the increases came after the university Council sat at its special meeting on May 20 and approved a 5.08% salary increase that the university management and organised labour agreed upon. “The university had decided to pay out the amount this week to reduce any unnecessary delays in getting the money to staff, who should have received it as part of their salaries since the beginning of the year,” Mkhize added. MUT acting vice-chancellor and principal, Professor Marcus Ramogale said this week the chief financial officer confirmed that the salary increase would be paid on Friday. “For some staff members, the amount paid may reflect a day after May 28, depending on the bank they use.
