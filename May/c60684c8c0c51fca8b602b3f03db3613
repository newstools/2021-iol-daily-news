DURBAN - A GLENWOOD resident thought the four months of inconvenience due to the massive fibre-optic cable-laying project in the area was over until her stormwater pipes were stolen. Ulandi Potgieter said this incident highlighted an issue that many more areas around the city would face in the coming weeks. She was disturbed by loud bangs outside her yard. “My husband and I ran out to find two vagrants in front of the house at the open trench, one with a heavy hammer and the other a green wheelie bin. When we shouted at them to stop, they retorted: ‘It’s just a pipe!’ Then swore at us and ran away but returned for the pipe, which they put into the wheelie bin and ran off,” Potgieter said. She recalled two other incidents were she could not get into her property and had to borrow a stepladder to jump over her wall, and another where they returned late from an outing only to find the contractors had dug in front of her garage and her husband had to shovel sand back so they could move their car into it. EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said fibre-optic cable was installed by private companies, but they obtained authorisation/ clearance from the city. “Our Roads and Stormwater Maintenance Department has dedicated a Clerk of Works who monitors these contractors and ensures compliance on site. They are the first point of contact in the event of any damages or non-compliance,” he said. Mayisela urged residents to report issues to Roads and Stormwater Maintenance at 031 322 7241. lorna.charles@inl.co.za Daily News
