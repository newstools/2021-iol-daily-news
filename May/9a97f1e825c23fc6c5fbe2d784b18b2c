WILLEM PHUNGULA DURBAN - KWAZULU-NATAL Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has called for the arrest of a school security guard who allegedly severely beat a school girl pupil for late coming. The guard is employed in the private pupils' residences near Velangaye High School in Nkandla, northern KZN, to look after their safety. In a statement issued by the MEC on Tuesday Mshengu called for the suspension of the guard without pay and for him to be arrested. Education spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa said that there was nothing the department could do about the incident because it happened outside school premises. He said a case should be opened by the pupilâ€™s parents. The school principal, Sibongiseni Ntuli, told the Daily News that they only became aware of the incident on Tuesday after seeing it on social media. He said he was busy compiling a report to the MEC after he had met the pupil's parents this morning. The principal said the incident did not happen at the school but instead at the private residences where pupils are staying after school. He said he has met with owners of the pupils' residences who employed the security guard to discuss the matter. He said the pupil told him that she had come back to residences after 11pm and the guard punished her for that. "It will be difficult for us as school management to say more on the issue because it happened outside the school. Pupils are renting these rooms so we don't have control over the place. We can only advise parents to lay charges against the security (person)," said Ntuli. He said the incident happened earlier this month but the pupil did not report it to the school until her friends leaked it on social media. He said even teachers did not notice bruises on the pupil's legs because they wore long socks. Parents and residence owners were still locked in the meeting. Daily News
