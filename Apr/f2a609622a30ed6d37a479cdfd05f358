Durban - Traditional crafters who rely on reeds to create handicraft products such as baskets and sleeping mats have been dealt a blow when Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife﻿ cancelled the harvesting programme. Ezemvelo spokesperson Musa Mntambo explained that the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in the cancellation of the 2021 iNcema and reed harvesting programme at both uMlalazi Nature Reserve and iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Mntambo said the decision to cancel the harvest was based on the realisation that the popularity of this harvesting programme would have made it difficult, for scores of mainly women who would have come, to adhere to the lockdown regulations like social distancing and applicable number limitations. The annual harvesting of natural resources, particularly Sea Rush (Juncus kraussii), has taken place 25 times in the last 32 years (1988-2019)  within Ezemvelo Reserves. Communities across KwaZulu-Natal, including Ladysmith, Vryheid and Melmoth, have benefited from the iNcema and Reed Harvesting Programme managed by Ezemvelo. Mntambo said the sought-after Sea Rush, including species such as Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and iKhwane (Cyperus latifolius) are often harvested over a controlled period in May. These natural resources are used to make different traditional handicraft products like baskets, sleeping mats and beer strainers. “The biennial natural resource harvesting programme facilitates wetland recovery.  In recent years, the vegetation component within the wetland system has shifted, favouring species such as common reed that dominate in freshwater as opposed to higher saline water conditions. Monitoring the wetland system allows for management interventions to be applied when necessary,” said Mntambo. Ezemvelo will continue to monitor these natural resources within the protected areas and would re-evaluate stock availability in early 2022. The Daily News
