DURBAN - THE Inkatha Freedom Party has called for the Road Accident Fund to be put under administration as it struggles to carry out its duties. On Sunday, IFP spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa said: “The RAF should be placed under administration with immediate effect and the development of new operational processes, to be spearheaded by National Treasury, Department of Transport, Department of Health, Department of Justice and the AG in collaboration with the Administrator, must be implemented.” He said the appointment of future boards must be a public process conducted by an independent panel, that would get the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise. These skills would include financial management, which followed the law and best practices. “In its current form, the RAF is not fit for its purpose,” he said. On Saturday, the Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula told RAF board members, treasury and transport officials that he was under no illusions about the challenges that were facing the RAF. It was reported last week that the RAF had been losing billions of rands through double payments, legal costs and other loss-incurring activities. Some of these loss-incurring activities include paying too much for medical assessments – where a neurosurgeon would be paid R32 000 per assessment, and R29 000 to an orthopaedic surgeon. mphathi.nxumalo@inl.co.za Daily News
