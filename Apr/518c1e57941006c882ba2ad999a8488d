DURBAN - THE KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health is moving closer to vaccinating all of their health workers after vaccinating more than 51 000 by last Friday. At the weekend, Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu provided an update on Covid-19 in the province. She covered the vaccine roll-out and the third wave in KZN. Simelane-Zulu was speaking at the official opening of the renamed Mfundo Lushaba Community Health Centre in Umzumbe, on the KZN south coast. As of Saturday, 334 925 people had been infected with Covid-19 in the province, with 4 827 active cases, 318 964 recoveries, 10 270 deaths and 131 new cases. Simelane-Zulu said last week that KZN had contributed 22% of Covid-19 cases in the country. “Our numbers are fluctuating, which indicates that the virus is still among us and living with us,” she said. She said the vaccination process was also continuing well, with 51 243 vaccinations conducted since the process started. “As a province, we have a little over 82 000 (health workers), which means we’ve surpassed 50%. It means we need a small number of doses so that all health workers are vaccinated.” She said as soon as health workers were vaccinated they would start Phase 2 which is for front-line workers, people 60-year-old and above, and people with comorbidities. Simelane-Zulu said of the first 80 000 doses that the country had received on February 16, KZN had received 10 800. The second batch of 80 000 doses was received at the beginning of March, with KZN being allocated 15 120 vaccines (public sector 10 585 and private sector 4 535). A further breakdown of the vaccines is as follows: eThekwini catchment areas 2 200 vaccines, Edendale 4 760, General Justice Gizenga Mpanza 1 280 and Madadeni 2 345. She said vaccination for the private sector was taking place at Netcare St Augustine’s Hospital in Durban and the Madadeni Medi-clinic in Newcastle. The third batch of 80 000 doses for the country has also been received and distributed at hospitals. GJ Crookes received 3 800 (private sector 200), Ladysmith 2 400 (private sector 300), Medi-clinic 1 800, St Augustine’s 5 600 (public sector 800), Dundee 1 600, Vryheid Christ the King 1 600 and Ngwelezane 2 000 (private sector 200). Hlabisa Hospital will receive its vaccines during the next round of the vaccination campaign, which starts this week. Simelane-Zulu said several districts and hospitals were in line to receive vaccines on Tuesday. She added that St Augustine’s and its catchment hospitals would receive 8 000 doses (50/50 for the private and public sectors), Medi-clinic (uMgungundlovu) will receive 500 doses (50/50 for the private and public sectors), Ladysmith (uThukela) and catchment hospitals will receive 1 500 doses (private sector 10%), Vryheid (Zululand) and catchment hospitals will receive 1 000 doses (private sector 10%), Ngwelezane and catchment hospitals will receive 2 200 doses (private sector 20%) and Hlabisa, Umkhanyakude and catchment hospitals, including Benedictine, Nkonjeni and St Francis, will receive 4 400 doses (private sector 10%). She added that there were currently no signs of a third wave, but emphasised the importance of following protocols so that there is no third wave. “There is a worry, but we’re vigilant and we’re ready as the Health Department like we were ready during the second wave. So if it reaches us, we’ll know what to do,” she said. thobeka.ngema@inl.co.za Daily News
