SINENHLANHLA ZUNGU DURBAN - BLACK Sash and #PayTheGrants are demanding that the government extend the Covid-19 Social Relief Distress (SRD) grant until it is turned into a Basic Income Guarantee (BIG). Black Sash spokesperson Esley Philander said it was unacceptable that the government plans to terminate the SRD grant this month. The grant was initially distributed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. “As the third wave is expected, the grant should also be prolonged,” Philander suggested. #PayTheGrant’s co-ordinator Nathan Taylor emphasised the need for economic justice for ordinary South Africans. The Black Sash human rights organisation together with #PayTheGrants not only want the grant to be extended, but to be increased as well. They want the grant to match the food poverty line which is R585. Lastly, Black Sash and #PayTheGrants, want the government to implement the BIG, for people aged between 18 and 59 years and have little to no income. Black Sash want the current BIG to at least match the UpperBound Poverty Line of R1 268. The two organisations will host a virtual press conference on Thursday. Faith-based organisations, trade unions and civic groups are also expected to join the conference as well as the Department of Justice and Bishop Victor Phalana. The online campaign has a heading that reads “Extend + increase R350 SRD grant until it’s turned into Basic Income Support” and can be accessed at Amandla.mobi. sinenhlanhla.zungu@inl.co.za Daily News
