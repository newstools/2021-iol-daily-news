DURBAN - IT APPEARS that problems faced by unemployed education graduates when using the department’s KZN qualified educators app have been resolved, and it is up and running, with some hopefuls already employed. In February, unemployed qualified teachers marched to the department’s offices in Pietermaritzburg over the online process of recruiting entry-level teachers, calling for it to be scrapped as it suffered from a multitude of technical problems and malfunctions. In February last year, the department launched its app. Its storage was affected due to a large number of applicants (30 000), rendering it dysfunctional, and it underwent routine maintenance. While it was not working, candidates were redirected to a web portal version. A Chatsworth woman said she felt fortunate after having only sought employment from August last year to have been placed at a school. The woman, who did not want to be named, said she received a phone call on Thursday last week asking her to pick up an appointment letter from Truro House in Durban the next morning and to report to the school. “This is good news for us unemployed educators. If you have not registered yet on the app (KZN qualified unemployed educators), please do so. If you did not receive the call yet, be patient and pray. Your time will come,” she said. The woman said that while grateful to have been placed at a school (in Ntuzuma), she would have preferred placement in the area where she lived. She said the fact she had been up for a position did not reflect on the app and she had no other communication regarding it except for the phone call. Department spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi confirmed the app was working. “We have said the app is the plane we are fixing while in flight,” he said. anelisa.kubheka@inl.co.za Daily News
