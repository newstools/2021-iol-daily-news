SINENHLANHLA ZUNGU DURBAN - A customer was allegedly assaulted by three security guards at Keyes Night Club on Florida Road on Saturday night. Lyle Coughlan told the Daily News the events took place just after 10pm when he was leaving the nightclub with his girlfriend, his sister and his sister’s boyfriend. The group had been attending a Candy Crush event at the club to celebrate a friend’s birthday. “I was walking out of the club when one of the bouncers pushed me out of the way. I asked him why he did that and he said I had a big mouth and started dragging me outside to the back and started beating me up.” Lyle’s mother Genevieve Coughlan received a phone call from her daughter during the incident. “My daughter called around 10pm and told me that her brother was being beaten up while she and Lyle’s girlfriend couldn’t do anything but watch.” She called the club manager Gareth Brissett who allegedly told her that he was “tired of people coming to my establishment while showing no respect for it“. The Daily News contacted Brissett for comment with no reply. Coughlan’s girlfriend, who did not want to be named, confirmed the incident outside the club. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was being investigated by Berea SAPS. “It is alleged by the complainant that on  April 10, 2021 at 10.30pm, he was assaulted by three security guards while he was in one of the restaurants on Florida Road. He sustained injuries on the head and body. The matter is still under investigation.” sinenhlanhla.zungu@inl.co.za Daily News
