DURBAN - Miss Universe South Africa, Natasha Joubert, 23, has revealed some of the outfits she will be wearing at the 69th Miss Universe pageant in Florida in the US on May 16, when our own Zozibini Tunzi crown her successor at the event. Joubert, a BComm graduate, felt she was fully prepared for competition. Her preparations started after being crowned Miss Universe SA last year. Joubert’s national costume – which she showed off at her Miss Universe farewell as part of her #DestinyDesigned virtual fashion show – has been designed by award-winning fashion designer to the stars Gert-Johan Coetzee, while Jolandie Fouche, of Jolache Couture, was responsible for a number of evening gowns for the pageant. Joubert would be carrying the children of South Africa with her when she walks on to the international stage in her national costume. The fabric wings of her unique gown have been printed with drawings made by young children from Diepsloot and Randburg. The artwork tells the story of pre-school children’s very personal experiences of lockdown and how the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted their young lives. Coetzee said she wanted to create something special and proudly South African. “We decided to take sketches from local children, to portray how they currently see the state of the world in their own ‘words’. We took their actual sketches, digitised them and printed them on white flowy fabric and created an angelic silhouette for Natasha to symbolise overcoming hardship through guidance,”Coetzee said. zainul.dawood@inl.co.za Daily News
