Durban - KWAZULU-Natal government departments were one of the major contributors of invoices older than 30 days not paid between October and December 31, 2020. Government departments continue to experience challenges with paying suppliers on time, said Public Service Commission (PSC) commissioner Michael Seloane on Tuesday. In a list of non-payment of suppliers in KZN,  the number of invoices included 1 159 in October, 830 in November and 1 149 in  December. The amounts were R71 929 037 (October), R37 217 997 (November) and R104 363 510 (December).  The figures for individual municipalities were not given. Seloane said the most noteworthy were the departments of Public Works and Infrastructure, including Property Management and Trading Entity (PMTE), and Water and Sanitation, including Trading Entity. Public Works and Infrastructure (including PMTE) reported an increase in the related cost owed to suppliers from R40 476 552 for 128 invoices at the end of quarter 2 (September 2020) to R51 673 929 for 116 invoices in quarter 3. “Water and Sanitation (including the Trading Entity) reported a decline in the related cost, from R544 838 250 for 641 invoices to R357 636 504 for 480 invoices during the same period,” Seloane said. The South African Police Service reported a notable increase  from R512 for one invoice in October to R71 674 for 17 invoices in December. Both departments needed to be monitored closely, Seloane said. The Mineral Resources and Energy department reflected a significant increase in the amount owed to suppliers, from R876 202 for two invoices at end of September 2020 to  4 311 452 for 15 invoices at the end of December 2020. Home Affairs owed R90 604 for 8 invoices at the end of September 2020 to R 636 813 for the same number of invoices at the end of December 2020. Seloane said in the case of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, there is still no follow through on consequence management regarding its invoice of R1 712 016, which has become a staring feature of the department, starting from quarter 1 of the 2020/2021 financial year. “The department must realise the importance of paying suppliers on time as this impacts on their business operations. “This might be as a result of gross negligence on the part of the department. It shows a lack of consequence management or accountability,” Seloane said. Despite the regulatory requirements some departments are still not submitting the required information to the National Treasury on time. “The Environment, Forestry and Fisheries department has not submitted any reports as per Treasury regulations for the 2020/21 financial year. “The information from National Treasury indicates that the Civilian Secretariat for the Police Service submitted reports for October and November 2020, however, reports for quarter 1 and 2 were not submitted.” Land Reform and Rural Development only submitted reports for April 2020 (quarter 1) and October 2020 (quarter 3) with no reports submitted for quarter 2 (July, August and Sept 2020).
