DURBAN - A CALL has been made for harsh consequences for a Department of Education district director who was involved in irregular dealings in securing a venue for a matric boot camp that broke all Covid-19 regulations last year. The investigation came after pictures of this boot camp surfaced, showing pupils cramped in a tent with no masks in a facility with overflowing toilets. They had been at the Boniwe Rehabilitation Centre in Umzinto preparing for the final exams. On Tuesday, Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu briefed the media on a report into the investigation of the procurement of the venue. The report recommended that disciplinary processes be taken against the district director, the acting chief education specialist and an assistant director supply chain manager. Mshengu said the centre was not tax-compliant. He said the investigation revealed that there was a school nearby with boarding facilities that could have been used. “The service providers were issued with multiple orders for the same service within the same period in order to keep the amount below the threshold of R500000, therefore, avoiding to go on tender as required. That the centre quoted R1.26m and the district director acted beyond her delegated authority to approve the centre and, therefore, splitting of quotation was done intentionally,” said Mshengu. He said it was found that the centre was appointed before submitting quotations. IFP MPL Mntomuhle Khawula said he was disappointed and concerned that children were put at risk. DA spokesperson on Education and MPL Imran Keeka said they expected the MEC to summarily suspend the district manager, pending a comprehensive disciplinary process. anelisa.kubheka@inl.co.za Daily News
