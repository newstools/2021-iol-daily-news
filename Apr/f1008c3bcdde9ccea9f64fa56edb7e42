IOL previously reported that hordes of students made their way to DUT’s Steve Biko campus after a hoax message was circulated on social media, calling for walk-ins. Yesterday, DUT issued a statement saying they would shut down their campuses, however, online registration for first-time entering students with firm offers would proceed. Chairperson of the National Assembly’s portfolio committee on higher education, science and technology, Philly Mapulane, has called for constructive engagement between the university management, university council and students, through their representative council, to ensure that both parties reach an amicable solution to challenges that face the university. “The committee appeals to all the leaders at the university to maintain peace at all the university campuses. We are appealing to everyone to avoid the use of force and violence at the university,” Mapulane said. IOL
