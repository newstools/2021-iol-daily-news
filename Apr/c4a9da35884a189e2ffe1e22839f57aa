DURBAN - A magistrate, medical doctor and licensing officials are expected to appear in the Eerstehoek Regional Court in Mpumalanga on Wednesday on allegations of the irregular and corrupt issuing of a driving licence. The accused are KwaZulu-Natal magistrate Bonginkosi Mtshali, 56, Dr Makhomba Nkambule, 56, examiner ST Thwala, 44, and officials BJ Mamba, 56, SM Mathebula, 43, and ZM Ndhlandhla, 35. The five allegedly conspired to ensure that a driving licence was fraudulently issued to Mtshali. In a statement on Wednesday, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) said the offence was committed in 2018 at Elukwatini licensing centre. Five of the suspects – the medical doctor, three driving licence examiners and a data capturer – were arrested last week in a joint operation by the SAPS and the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit from the RTMC. The magistrate was arrested in Empangeni a week before. The accused face charges relating to conspiracy to commit fraud and defeating the ends of justice. They are currently all out on R2 000 bail each. In March, the RTMC National Anti-Corruption Unit assisted by the Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation Unit, arrested five traffic officials, three administration clerks, four jockeys, two examiners and a driving school instructor in Bethlehem and Harrismith, Eastern Free State. People who participated or obtained their licences in such a manner are urged to come forward so that the validity of their licences can be verified, as an audit and verification process will be conducted to verify licences issued. The public are urged to join the ongoing campaign against fraud and corruption in the traffic sector by resisting to pay bribes, and to report such incidents on 0861 400 800 or email: Ntacu@rtmc.co.za. WhatsApp messages can be sent to 083 293 7989. zainul.dawood@inl.co.za Daily News
