We have signs out there so that people can be aware of certain signs such as headaches, dizziness, and abdominal cramps. ’’If they have any sense of discomfort that they feel, they should make sure that they get checked so we can be on the lookout for these symptoms,” said Mkhize. The government has until Friday to establish the no-fault Covid-19 vaccination compensation fund, a requirement from vaccine manufacturers Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Mkhize told parliament’s portfolio committee on health on Wednesday that the regulations have been published. “We are hoping that it will make it easier for people to understand that we are protecting them further as the government, so that there is no-one who is exposed to a risk without any form of redress,” said Mkhize. South Africa is likely to experience a third wave of Covid-19 infections during winter, when temperatures drop and people’s immunity will be weakened. This is according to epidemiologist Profesoor Salim Abdool Karim, who until recently was chair of the ministerial advisory committee on Covid-19. “When I look at the trends, there is a reasonable likelihood we may see the third wave at the end of June and in July. That is when we are mostly indoors,” Karim said in an interview on SAfm on Wednesday. IOL
