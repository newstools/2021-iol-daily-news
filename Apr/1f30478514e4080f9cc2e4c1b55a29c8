DURBAN - THE extension of a contract for contractors and developers of a housing development in uMlazi T-section has the DA and IFP not seeing eye to eye. On Tuesday, the development project was tabled in a report by the eThekwini Municipality’s Human Settlements, Engineering and Infrastructure Unit. The report requested the approval to extend these contracts. The extension would cost about R19.1 million for the construction of 54 new units. DA Human Settlement and Infrastructure caucus whip Zamani Khuzwayo said the project was completed two or three years ago, and R19.1m was a lot of money. “We want people to go into the houses, but we are unhappy about the amount of money being spent.” The report said uMlazi’s T-section was earmarked for a 10-year redevelopment project to address the inhumane conditions in which people were living, as well as fixing structural defects. There are currently two companies working on the project. According to the report: “Presently, the municipality is losing millions of rand due to a lack of rental payment because the existing structures are structurally defective and dwellers generally resist making rental payments. “The procurement of alternative contractors may be counter-productive and undo all the good achievements already secured, take a longer time and fail the municipality in meeting the requirements of Covid-19 regulations.” IFP councillor Mdu Nkosi said the DA did not have a good understanding of the matter. “The DA has never supported hostel development. The IFP supports development everywhere it happens.” mphathi.nxumalo@inl.co.za Daily News
