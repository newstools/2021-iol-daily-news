According to a resident, the body is believed to be of a local woman who was reported missing by her family on Sunday. A community member in the area said a man known to the woman and her family had been arrested following the family reporting the woman missing.

It’s suspected that on his release he went and took the body from where he had hidden it and came out here to dump it in the open where it could be found," he said. The community member added: "As a community here in J section we are saddened by what has happened. Gender based violence is something we see and hear on the news all the time, we discourage it. Our sisters and girl children should be protected in communities not killed in such brutal and horrific manner."
