DURBAN - A man suspected of driving a stolen vehicle got out of his car in traffic and pointed a toy firearm at a police car pursuing him on the N2 Nandi Drive. He is under police guard in hospital after he was shot in the leg by police. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the Phoenix Trio Crime Task Team received information that a vehicle that was hijacked in Isipingo on Tuesday was travelling on the N2 freeway towards the Umgeni interchange. Gwala said the team followed up information and the vehicle was spotted on the freeway. “Upon seeing the police officers, the suspect sped off through the Petroport towards the N2 northbound. The suspect slowed down his vehicle, jumped off and pointed a firearm at the police officers. The police officers fired a shot. It struck him on the right leg. A toy gun was found in his possession,” Gwala said. Charges of pointing a firearm and possession of stolen property have been opened for investigation by Newlands East SAPS. On the same day, police officers from the National Intervention Unit received information about suspects who escaped from Pietermaritzburg New Prison on April 28. Police proceeded to Fairfield Road in Scottsville. They spotted a vehicle entering a home where the suspects were hiding. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said when police approached the gate they were met by a hail of bullets from different corners of the house. During the exchange of gunfire, seven suspects were wounded. Four pistols, a rifle, shotgun and an AK-47, ammunition and large quantities of cigarettes were seized. Mbele said two vehicles were recovered at the scene. The vehicles were reported stolen at Thornville and Pietermaritzburg in May. Daily News
