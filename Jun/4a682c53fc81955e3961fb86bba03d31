Durban - The Durban FilmMart Institute has announced the participants of the 14th edition of Talents Durban, which takes place virtually during the Durban FilmMart from 16-25 July. Initiated by the Berlin International Film Festival and Berlinale Talents, Talents Durban is an important partner programme of the Durban FilmMart Institute. This training and development platform offers the selected Talent participants a 6-week mentorship and an opportunity to present their film projects to an international market. “Working with international partners is key to providing African filmmakers access to international markets and this is a strategic goal of the Durban FilmMart Institute,” says Magdalene Reddy, acting General Manager of the Durban FilmMart Institute. “Now celebrating 14 years in Africa, the 2021 edition of Talents Durban will introduce Francophone projects from the African diaspora as it continues to inspire a sense of community on the continent by representing many languages and cultures.” After a rigorous adjudication process, 28 film projects and 6 film critics from 15 countries across the continent made the final cut with 6 fiction features, 4 episodics (TV/Web series), 5 animations, 6 documentaries, 7 fiction short films, and 6 film critics being selected.
