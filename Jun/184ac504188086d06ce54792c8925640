DURBAN - Hundreds of educators gathered at KwaMashu Sports Centre on Wednesday morning to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. KwaZulu-Natal province has launched its mass vaccination drive for teachers. It is being led by the KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu and Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane. Mshengu said teachers were exposed to Covid-19 as they interacted with learners and the rest of the community daily. "Teachers are among the front-line workers and that is why we have put them on the priority list to be vaccinated against Covid-19," said Mshengu. One of the teachers at the centre said that she was excited to get vaccinated. “I can’t wait to get the vaccine. I’ve been longing for it and if it’s the only thing that is going to protect me and my pupils, I’m willing to do it. As soon as I was made aware that we could register, I did register the same day,” the teacher said. At the weekend, the Basic Education Department announced that the vaccination roll-out would start on Wednesday and run for two weeks, until July 8. The department said it had received the 300 000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines to vaccinate teachers and other education staff.    THE MERCURY
