Pfizer said it had an agreement with the government to supply doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) to the country in 2021. On May 2, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the arrival of the first batch of their Covid-19 vaccine in SA. “While the details of the agreement are confidential, we can confirm that deliveries remain on track and continue to progress in line with the schedule, agreed in advance with the government,” Pfizer said. Ramaphosa said over the past seven days, there was an average of 3 745 daily new infections, a 31% increase from the week before and an increase of 66% from the week before that. Ramaphosa said the Free State, Northern Cape, North West and Gauteng had reached the threshold of the third wave of infections and it may only be a matter of time before the whole country entered the third wave. Ramaphosa said nearly 480 000 health workers were vaccinated during Phase 1, with more than 67% public health workers vaccinated. “Over the past two weeks, over 480 000 people have received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine as part of the public vaccination campaign. In total, over 960 000 people in South Africa have received one vaccine dose.” Ramaphosa said more than 3 million people had registered on the Electronic Vaccination Data System and that there were now more than 400 vaccination sites in operation across the country. “We have secured enough vaccines to reach all adults in the country, which is around 40 million people.” “This includes 31 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is a single dose, and which will be manufactured here in South Africa. It includes 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which requires two doses to provide full protection.” According to the president, about 1.3 million Pfizer doses have already been distributed and nearly 500 000 administered.
