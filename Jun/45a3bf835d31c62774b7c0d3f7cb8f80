DURBAN - INDEPENDENT Media’s marketing team is launching a Winter Challenge Campaign to raise funds for the Aryan Benevolent Home (ABH) in Chatsworth. ABH has a shortage of personal procurement equipment (PPE) and is urging the public to donate funds. Covid-19 has taken a great toll on the home. “We need funds to provide masks, sanitisers and protective suits for our staff. We also ensure that our home is regularly fogged. These measures cost our home an additional R100 000 per month. It is also challenging for us to balance our monthly deficit and raise R517 000 each month through donations,” said Naren Pattundeen, ABH’s chief executive officer. Approximately 500 of ABH residents were the elderly who were more susceptible to contracting Covid-19, and not having enough PPEs was the worst case scenario. “All our physical fundraisers like the ABH Chatsworth Fair and our fundraising events at our Pattundeen Theatre have been cancelled since March last year. The ABH Chatsworth Fair is one of our biggest fundraisers. In addition, our ABH Charity Store temporarily closed. We need to buy food, PPEs, medication and cover our daily expenses. We have to pay staff salaries,” said Pattundeen. “Corporates and the public are urged to participate in the Winter Challenge Campaign as it would make a remarkable difference.” The ABH is a national non-profit organisation which provides shelter and 24-hour care. One can join the Independent Winter Challenge Campaign by donating any amount to ABH’s bank account. Donors of R25 000 or more stand a chance to get a free 15x3 advert; terms and conditions still apply. Donors are urged to email their proof of payment to kznevents@inl.co.za to qualify.
