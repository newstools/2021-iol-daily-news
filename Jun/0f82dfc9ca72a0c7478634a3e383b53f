DURBAN - A WOMAN arrested in connection with the murder of uMlazi K9 unit police officer sergeant Siyabonga Radebe was apparently taking revenge after the officer confiscated liquor she was selling without a licence. Police shot and killed one alleged hitman on Saturday night, and arrested two suspects – together with a car that was allegedly used as a getaway vehicle after the officer’s killing. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the provincial Trio Task Team went to W Section in uMlazi after receiving information that the suspects were celebrating the death of the police officer. She said that on arrival one suspect pointed a firearm at the police officers who then shot and killed the armed suspect and also arrested two others. Colonel Mbele said police then proceeded to C Section in uMlazi and arrested a woman, who is a relative of the murdered officer. She said the suspects were expected to appear in uMlazi Magistrate’s Court on Monday. A source close to the Radebe family told Daily News on Sunday that the woman was a well-known school transport operator who owned a Quantum taxi. He said that during lockdown the murdered police officer was allegedly among the officers who raided her house and confiscated liquor she was selling illegally during the lockdown. Sergeant Radebe, 34, was shot and killed while playing a game of pool with friends at C Section in uMlazi on Tuesday night. A witness said on the day of Radebe’s shooting, two men entered the venue and went straight to him. One of the suspects grabbed his hand and took his bag, while another suspect shot him at close range. According to police, the two men fired several shots at the officer. The officer was rushed to the hospital in a private vehicle, but was declared dead on arrival. Police said he had several gunshot wounds. The funeral is expected to take place this week. Daily News
