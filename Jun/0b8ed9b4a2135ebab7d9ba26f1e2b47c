When the police proceeded to the scene, she said, they found the wife of the deceased – who told them that two unknown males entered the house and shot her 50-year-old husband and his guest, aged 35 years. “While the suspects were about to exit the premises, they shot and wounded the deceased’s son in the foot,” she said. Mbele said all three victims were rushed to a local clinic, where a 50-year-old male succumbed to his injuries. “The other victim, who was shot in the foot, was treated and discharged, while the third victim is still critical in hospital,” Mbele said.
