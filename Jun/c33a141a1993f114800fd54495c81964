DURBAN - THE State intends to oppose the bail application of a G4S Cash Solutions employee accused of stealing R2.4 million from his employer. Sihle Lungisani Ngcobo, 32, appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Monday where his matter was adjourned until June 8 for a formal bail application. National Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said Ngcobo, from KwaDukuza, was arrested by the Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation team for the alleged theft. “In December 2019, Ngcobo, an employee at G4S, allegedly stole R2.4m from the G4S Cash Solutions depot in Westville. A case was opened, which prompted the Hawks’ investigation,” Mogale said. After a thorough investigation, she said a warrant for Ngcobo’s arrest was issued by the court. According to Mogale, Ngcobo had been on the run since the theft incident but was later arrested with the help of the police’s Crime Intelligence Unit. “The suspect allegedly built a house from the suspected stolen millions and therefore the Asset Forfeiture Unit will assist with further investigation,” Mogale said.
