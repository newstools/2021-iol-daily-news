The minister told Jacaranda FM: “With regards to those who are criticising us and claiming we are giving preference to inmates above society, that criticism is unfounded. Older inmates were vaccinated when the population 60 years and above received their jabs. “When it was 50 years and above, they participated with everyone in society, so there was no preference. The reality is we are going to go further than that with the health department so we are able to reach herd immunity.” Where's your health pass? Visitors heading to museums, cinemas or swimming pools in France were denied entry from Wednesday if they cannot show the document that proves they have been vaccinated against Covid -19 or have had a recent negative test. The health pass, previously only required for large-scale festivals or to go clubbing, will also be needed from the start of August to enter restaurants and bars and for long-distance train and plane journeys, as authorities try to slow the spread of the virus and encourage people to get vaccinated. The introduction of the health pass - a QR code on your smartphone or on a piece of paper - has proved hugely contentious in France, triggering protests nationwide. Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday forecast just $2.5 billion in 2021 sales of its Covid-19 vaccine, which has fallen way behind rival shots from Pfizer and Moderna as the company deals with vaccine production issues and safety concerns.
