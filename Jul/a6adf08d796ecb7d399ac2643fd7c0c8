Speaking on Thursday, Cloete said: “Our third wave looks like a flattening in terms of the number of cases. However, if you look at oxygen use, hospitalisation and daily deaths, these are increasing.” Cloete said the third wave had been “slightly lower than the second wave” and that the Delta variant remains dominant. The province is seeing about 230 hospital admissions a day and there are now 3 010 people admitted to hospitals. Africa, battling a severe third wave of Covid-19 infections, will start to receive the first batch of 400 million doses of vaccines from Johnson & Johnson next week, the AU's special envoy on Covid-19 said on Thursday. Only about 60 million doses have been administered among a total population of 1.3 billion so far on the continent. IOL
