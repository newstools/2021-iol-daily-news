DURBAN - ESKOM will implement stage 2 load shedding from 4pm today. The utility giant announced that a shortage of generation capacity, coupled with the severely cold weather in parts of the country, have forced the implementation of stage 2 load shedding between 4pm and 9pm. “Unfortunately, a generation unit each at Tutuka and Medupi Power Stations were forced offline this afternoon, increasing the capacity constraints on the power system. “Further, a unit each at Medupi and Tutuka, that were expected to return to service this afternoon have now been delayed, further contributing to the shortages,” Eskom said in a statement. It said breakdowns currently total 14 137MW while planned maintenance accounts for 2 924MW of capacity. “Eskom regrets the inconvenience caused by these power constraints, and would like to urge the public to reduce the usage of electricity in order to help ease the pressure on the power system, and will communicate promptly should there be any significant changes to the performance of the system.” IOL
