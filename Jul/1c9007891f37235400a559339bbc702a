DURBAN - THE eThekwini Municipality and Umgeni Water have beefed up infrastructure security - including essential services vehicles, dam walls, waterworks and pipelines - after threats that electricity and water infrastructure was on the protesters’ target list. Municipality spokesperson Mandla Nsele said they were safeguarding key infrastructure. “In this regard, security and police personnel have been deployed to hotspots and strategic infrastructure areas and are escorting essential service vehicles to curb any further disruptions and ensure the safety of infrastructure and staff.” Umgeni Water spokesperson Shami Harichunder said the heightened infrastructure security would be done through a service provider that managed security on their behalf. Umgeni Water operated, managed and owned infrastructure that was critical to water services provision and wastewater treatment around Durban. "Umgeni Water has increased monitoring and surveillance of its infrastructure, among them dam walls, water works and pipelines," said Harichunder. The increased surveillance came after a WhatsApp message was circulated, which Umgeni was also aware of. "Police services are also aware of the said WhatsApp message and Umgeni Water has shared information with them," he said. He added that the current situation in the province had meant all messages being distributed must be assessed closely. "It is therefore imperative that security alertness is heightened so that infrastructure is adequately safeguarded." Ugu Waterworks, which supplies water to the South Coast areas, warned of a potential disruption to water and sanitation services. Spokesperson France Zama said they had temporarily suspended portable water tanker services due to ongoing volatility in some parts of the districts and the escalating acts of torching of trucks.
