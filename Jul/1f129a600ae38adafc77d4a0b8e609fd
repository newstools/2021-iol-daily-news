DURBAN - FORMER MP and staunch critic of former president Jacob Zuma, Dr Makhosi Khoza, has lashed out at the judiciary after the arrest of Zuma. Speaking to the Daily News on Monday, Khoza lamented the decision by justices of the Constitutional Court, to use the institution to deal with issues of “contempt of court”, which was used to justify the arrest of Zuma without trial. She said the Concourt overstepped its authority and caused more damage to the country and the independence of the judiciary. She also blamed President Cyril Ramaphosa for fuelling ethnic and racial tensions when he addressed the nation, downplaying the events which led to the eruption of riots. “This is a 79-year-old Struggle veteran you throw into jail, during a time when we are struggling to contain a deadly virus. You disregard the history of the province and forget the role he played in bringing peace to this country. “Why would you throw him in jail and not house arrest, what’s there to gain?” She added: “You can talk corruption and everything you want about Zuma, but this is the man who took rural development seriously. Nkandla is an example of the change he brought. “Every time Ramaphosa raises his hand, people die. What kind of a leader is this? In Marikana and now in Kwazulu-Natal and Gauteng, people died.” She said the judiciary, and all the chapter nine institutions of the state, were compromised. “Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng told South Africans about the attempt to capture the judiciary. It appears that he was correct. The president never loses a case in our courts,” said Khoza. Ramaphosa’s spokesperson, Tyrone Seale, said he would not comment on “mere allegations”. Daily News
