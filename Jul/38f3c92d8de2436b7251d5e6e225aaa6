DURBAN - THE South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) is expected to issue Social Relief of Distress (SRD) food parcels, cash and vouchers limited to R700 to aid families severely affected by the looting and unrest that unfolded last week in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Sandy Godlwana, Sassa’s senior manager of communications and marketing, confirmed this, saying that SRD grants would be a temporary measure to help communities negatively and severely impacted by the protests. “Social grants are the cornerstone of the government’s key programmes to fight poverty afflicting the vulnerable. Through the SRD grant, the government is able to provide temporary assistance intended for persons in dire need that are unable to meet their families’ most basic needs,” she said. In order to receive the grant, applicants must meet the following criteria as stated by Sassa: When an applicant meets the above criteria, they are instructed to visit their nearest Sassa office to apply or a local Sukuma Sakhe War Room for assistance. A Sassa office in KwaMashu, KwaZulu-Natal, was vandalised during last week’s protests. Its infrastructure was damaged and vehicles were set alight. “Additionally, service providers who are contracted to provide SRD grants have had their stocks stolen which has led to the service providers halting their service. As a result, Sassa KZN is currently working around the clock to assess the extent of destruction and ensure that this service is rendered swiftly.” Meanwhile, the Gift of the Givers Foundation donated essential goods to KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng residents when they commemorated Mandela Day on Sunday.
