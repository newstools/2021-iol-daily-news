Durban - Clean up teams are still busy removing debris, tree bark, wood and litter from the Blue Lagoon/Umgeni River mouth and Beachwood Mangroves Nature Reserve following the heavy downpour of rain this week. The Department of Environment, Forestry & Fisheries conducts regular clean up campaigns along the coastline assisted by volunteers and contractors. Service provider CBN consulting spokesperson Ntsakisi  Malabi said a deluge of litter had flowed down the Umgeni River. Malabi expects the tree branches and logs sprawled on the beach sand to be raked up and removed by the end of the week. This week tons of litter on the beach sand and inside the mangroves was removed by hand and placed into bags for removal. Volunteer group  ADreach Group river rangers stated on Facebook the rains had brought a devastating amount of waste to the area. This comprised mainly of empty plastic bottles. The clean up prevents most of the litter from floating out to sea due to tidal action.
