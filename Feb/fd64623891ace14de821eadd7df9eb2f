Durban -  eThekwini Municipality Deputy Mayor Belinda Scott has allegedly resigned from her position as deputy mayor within the eThekwini Municipality. Sources at the City Hall and with the Executive Committee of eThekwini said the resignation will come into effect at end of February 2021. An official statement has not been released detailing reasons why she resigned. In August 2019, Scott took over as deputy from then acting mayor, Fawzia Peer. Scott was the MEC of Finance in KwaZulu-Natal. A source said following the Durban Solid Waste tender saga, Scott was brought in to clean up the finance department at the municipality. This put Scott directly in the hot seat and often found her taking flak from both opposition parties and her own party members within the ANC-led municipality. Soon after her appointment, KZN DA leader Zwakele Mncwango took a swipe at her. Scott also questioned the credibility of eThekwini Municipality’s budget, saying the amount of fiscal shifting in the middle of the year was “unbelievable”. Scott, the chairperson of the finance, security and emergency services committee, said the poor state of the municipality’s adjustment budget “was indicative of a city that did not have a credible budget”. She was speaking on the adjustments budget for 2018/19 at the executive committee meeting in City Hall last year. A source claimed that some officials wrote to the City Manager recently stating that they could not work with Scott. The source alleged that since her appointment, Scott had asked the PEC if she could resign as she claimed that people were hostile towards her. Scott left the Inkatha Freedom Party for the Democratic Party and then joined the ANC. Daily News
