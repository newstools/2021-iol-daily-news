Easter weekend: Brace for the Covid-19 perfect storm Arrogance, poor decision-making and a “non-existent” vaccine strategy are some of the key ingredients for the country’s impending Covid-19 perfect storm in the coming weeks. These are also some of the choice phrases used by leading South African vaccinologist Professor Shabir Madhi to describe government’s bungling of its Covid-19 response, including its national vaccination drive. Madhi said that the Easter holidays coupled with the lag in vaccinations and the upcoming winter season could have devastating effects on the country and was a serious cause for concern. “Our vaccine strategy is non-existent. South Africa is one of only 44 countries in the world to have not started a proper vaccination drive. “Given the current situation, in all likelihood we will see a third wave starting possibly after the Easter break, which means that come May, we could be in the midst of the third wave when the next phase of vaccinations are scheduled to begin. “Carrying out a vaccination drive during a resurgence is not ideal and sadly those at high risk will be more compromised,” he said.
