Durban: The KwaZulu-Natal Drug and Firearm Unit recovered drugs worth an estimated street value of R292 185 on Friday. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the drugs were seized during a police operation in one of the flats in the Point area. Police were following up on information that drugs were being kept in a flat, ready for distribution. “During the search, the police recovered 2 488 ecstasy tablets and 408.3g of cocaine powder. The total value of the recovered drugs is R292 185,” said Gwala. “The suspect is still being sought by police.” Gwala said an enquiry into the drugs was opened at Point police station. The bust comes days after the Hawks arrested Kingsley Ike Ikedi for allegedly manufacturing drugs, including a new drug with serious side effects. Ikedi was arrested in Pinetown on Tuesday in an intelligence-driven operation after  a tip-off. Police pounced on the suspect’s premises and a search found various equipment used to manufacture drugs, chemicals and a powder suspected to be methcathinone. The street value of the seized paraphernalia and drugs is about R1. 5 million. Ikedi appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday and was released on R50 000 bail. The case was adjourned until May 18. Meanwhile, since the start of March, police have arrested at least 10 men and women for drug dealing and drug possession in KwaZulu-Natal. Based on information from the SAPS and the Hawks, police have seized drugs with a street value of nearly R4m and nearly R200 000 in cash. Some of the drugs recovered were crystal meth, rock cocaine, heroin, mandrax and ecstasy. Police also seized various paraphernalia. thobeka.ngema@inl.co.za Daily News
