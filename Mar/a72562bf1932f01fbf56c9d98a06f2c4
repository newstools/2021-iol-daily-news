Durban - POLICE are letting the court decide the fate of a minibus taxi driver who allegedly ignored the pleas of his passengers as he crossed a low-lying bridge submerged under a raging river. Four passengers drowned after the vehicle was swept away in the river KweSentombi in Weenen at the weekend. Police recovered the bodies of Siphokuhle Chonco, 28, and Zama Ziqubu, 48, on Sunday. Spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said they had yet to find the bodies of an 18-year-old and a 35-year-old. Gwala said the driver had not been arrested, but police had opened inquest dockets and the court would decide whether or not to prosecute him. Gwala said the taxi driver managed to escape during the ordeal on Saturday. A woman, who managed to escape and who spoke to the Isolezwe newspaper, said passengers had pleaded with the driver not to cross the bridge as it looked dangerous. “The water was flowing over the bridge. The driver didn’t answer us when we pleaded with him not to cross the bridge and continued driving. We all screamed and shouted in fear as he continued, but our cries fell on deaf ears,” said 32-year-old Nomasonto Mvelase. She wanted to get counselling after the incident as it had left her shaken and it would take time before she forgot about it. A 30-second video clip of the taxi nearly completely submerged in the river was shared on social media. The spokesperson for the SA National Taxi Council (Santaco), Sfiso Shangase, said the taxi apparently did not operate in the area, but the driver was known and he had given people he knew a lift. “What we know is that he was coming from work in this taxi and gave his neighbours a lift. We will wait for the law to take its course.” IOL reported that the bodies were found by Ladysmith SAPS and Pietermaritzburg K9 search and rescue teams. Ziqubu’s body was found in the Umthezi River about 25m from where the taxi was swept away, while Chonco’s body was found next to the river. anelisa.kubheka@inl.co.za Daily News
