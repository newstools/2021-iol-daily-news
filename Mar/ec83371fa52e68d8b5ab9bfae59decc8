Durban - TWO of Umgeni Water’s major waterworks plants and a pump station were now exempt from load shedding, which had affected the supply of water. This was after talks between Umgeni Water and Eskom to have some water treatment plants excluded from load shedding. In January, Umgeni Water began meeting with Eskom as well as municipalities to discuss the exclusion of some of its major plants from load shedding as back-up power was not enough to keep the supply running. Spokesperson Shami Harichunder said that these large plants were Midmar Water Works and Durban Heights that produced raw water into potable drinking water. Harichunder said that Durban Heights Water Works in Reservoir Hills had already been exempt from load shedding. He said the Midmar Pump Station in Howick was also granted an exemption. “However, in the case of the Wiggins Pump Station, when power supply interruptions occur – in the current situation twice a day of two hours each – the water that has been treated cannot be transferred to municipal reservoirs,” said Harichunder. He said the transfer of water occurred when the power supply was restored while during the power outages and, if required, augmentation from the Durban Heights Water Works occurred. “However, power supply interruptions continue to affect pumping of raw water for treatment at some water treatment plants,” he said. One of the affected systems was on the South Coast in Umzinto, Mtwalume and Mhlabatshane. “Production of potable water decreases by between 40% and 50% during load shedding. This means that the full demand of municipalities cannot be met when power supply interruptions occur.” anelisa.kubheka@inl.co.za Daily News
