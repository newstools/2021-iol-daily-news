SINEHLANHLA ZUNGU Durban - THE University of Zululand feels positive about the launch of its new weekly supplement to be published in the Daily News from Tuesday. “The idea of the Ongoye Times supplement sprouted from the fact that the university has a lot of initiatives as part of image and brand building aimed at showcasing the positive stories that are happening in the university,” said Gcina Nhleko Mdluli, Unizulu’s director of communications and marketing. Nhleko went on to highlight why the Unizulu partnership with Independent Media would be beneficial. “For starters, it will improve and develop communications and marketing initiatives that are in keeping with international standards of a comprehensive university,” said Nhleko. The partnership, she said, would also enhance and showcase external communications among the staff, students and management with an equivalent approach in keeping stakeholders. “Lastly, it will enhance and protect institutional reputation, advance and strengthen the university’s brand and encourage community engagement as well as reinforce the university’s relevance to the key stakeholders,” said Nhleko. She hoped the supplement would showcase Unizulu’s great strides and core mandate which was teaching, learning, research, innovation and community engagement. sinenhlanhla.zungu@inl.co.za Daily News
