Durban - TWO Shallcross men are expected to appear in the Chatsworth Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday for being in possession of unlicensed firearms. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the task team from Chatsworth police station acted swiftly on information of random shootings in Taurus Street, Shallcross, on Sunday night. “Both the SAPS and Durban Metro Police proceeded to the area and kept observation. Three people were arrested. Two suspects aged 42 and 43 were found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. The third suspect, aged 25, was found in possession of unlicensed ammunition,” Mbele said. Further investigations revealed that the serial numbers on both revolvers had been erased. Acting KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner, Major-General Thulani Gonya, praised the task team for acting swiftly resulting in the arrests. “The police will not tolerate any lawlessness in the community. They will arrest perpetrators who commit criminal acts and place them before the criminal justice system. The firearms seized will be sent for ballistic testing to establish if they were used in the commission of any other offence,” Gonya said. The arrests were made in the vicinity of the late Yaganathan Pillay’s turf. Pillay, who was also known as “Teddy Mafia”, was killed in his home on Taurus Street in January. The police are still investigating his murder. Shallcross Crime Forum spokesperson Mahendra Lillkant declined to comment on the random shootings. zainul.dawood@inl.co.za Daily News
