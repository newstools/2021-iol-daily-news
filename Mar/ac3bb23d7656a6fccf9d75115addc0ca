ON March 24, four years ago, hundreds of Durban residents woke up to see clouds of black smoke billowing across the sky following a massive fire at a Transnet warehouse in South Coast Road. According to reports, more than 20 fire trucks rushed to the scene and emergency services evacuated people out of the neighbouring buildings, in a desperate bid to contain the flames. The fire had spread to a second neighbouring warehouse. The warehouse, a wax factory, spewed a massive pall of smoke over the harbour and the city. The black cloud be seen as far away as Ballito on the North Coast. At the time, ALS medic Garrith Jamieson said the wax panels and strong winds on the day made it challenging for fire teams to control the blaze, which burnt for four days.  @FatalMoves @ECR_Newswatch @TrafficSA @bereamail @IamAlexSweet @_ArriveAlive Fire 151 South Coast Rd Well alight. @bravedaveZA pic.twitter.com/mJ2Uf3aIZL  Residents took to social media, each sharing images of the black clouds and smoke.
