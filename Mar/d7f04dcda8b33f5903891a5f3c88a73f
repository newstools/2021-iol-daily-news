DURBAN - The 1000 Hills community tourism organisation is supporting the Kloof and Highway SPCA in an event-packed Easter weekend. The Easter family fun at the Kloof & Highway SPCA from 8am until 3pm on Saturday 3 April, will be Covid-compliant. Well-known creatives Kevin Ellis and Gareth Graves have put together an interactive programme of entertaining events for Saturday morning, all with an underlying Easter theme. The Easter Jive Bunny is scheduled to visit at around 11am to hand out Easter Eggs, donated by 1000 Hills Community Tourism Organisation. The Dance Magic Studio will be doing a demo, and leading kids (and parents) in some fun line dancing routines. Songstress Belinda Dolphin will be providing the vibes for the morning. All the Village Green shops, the Hidden Treasures marquee and the Tea Garden will be open. All activities will be raising much-needed funds which goes towards the upkeep, costs and the feeding of the rescued animals in their care. All events have been carefully planned to be Covid compliant and will take place outdoors. The Kloof & Highway SPCA is situated on 29 Village Road, Kloof.
